Problem 
/*Banking System Management 
Design a project to represent a bank account and its relevant operations, where following details can be maintained: 
1. Depositor name, 
2. account number(you may define any starting number), 
3. type of account, 
4. balance amount in the account. 
5. Any other attribute required you may add it by your own. 
Also, the following set of operations/actions should be provided: 
1. Add new customers to the bank who become an account holder. 
2. Display a list of all the account holders of the bank along with their account numbers and balance. 
3. Delete the information related to the account holder from the customer data file 4. Update the balance after customer has performed a deposit or withdraw transaction 5. display the account number of the last entry 
6. check whether an account exists or not 
7. retrieve the name of the account holder 
8. retrieve the address of the account holder 
9. retrieve the balance of the account holder 
10. returns the record number from the customer file when an employee of the bank enters the account number related to an account holder(Transaction details along with the account information) 
11. displays all the information related to an account holder from the customer file on the basis of specified account number. 
12. Calculate the interest to date on the deposit if a particular customer has not withdrawn for more than a month 
The project implementation should have following minimum criteria to be fulfilled:
1. You should create an appropriate number of classes to handle the similar nature of operations tightly bound with the data. This will demonstrate the appropriate skill about the OOPS 
2. Make sure the project operations should be user interactive and can be designed by considering the type of users(bank employee/ customers) 
3. Appropriate data files should be created to maintain the customer and bank transaction records. Object based storage should be done. 
4. Appropriate comments should be provided within the code for the operations implemented and their nature of calling. 
Note: The project can be separated into multiple file(if required)
